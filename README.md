# Getting started with feature flags

This is a sample project to introduce how to use feature flags using [Unleash](https://unleash.github.io/) used for the article in LogRocket that can be found [here](--link--pending)

## Make it run

- Clone the repository
- In the terminal install the dependencies with `npm install`
- Run `npm run server-debug`

## Contributing

This is a reference repository so I will only look into accepting any bug fix or improvement that doesn't vastly change the current content.

On the other hand, you're encouraged to fork and improve it in your own repository, let me know what you come up with ^^.
